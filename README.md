Python Course Material for TPRA 
The Best Place to Start
Before you can do anything with a programming language, you first need to configure the development environment. Now, we're going to cover how to setup Python and the interpreter that will execute your custom programs.

Python comes pre-installed on Mac and a majority of Linux distributions. However, you may need to download an updated version depending on how old your system is.
 
TIP: You can easily check your Python version by opening the terminal and running the following command:

python -V

If you're running Windows, you'll need to download Python from the Python Software Foundation (link below).
How Do I Get Python?
If you need to download Python, the best place to go is the official site. You'll need to download the version specific to your operating system and processor (32 or 64 bit).

Mac: Most Mac OS X computers already have Python 2.x installed, which is perfectly fine to use. The best way to install the latest version is to use Homebrew to activate and manage them. You'll find instructions on how to do that here. You can also download Python directly from the PSF if you prefer.

Linux: Python is included with most distributions of Linux. Check your current version and be sure to upgrade using the package manager, if necessary.
 
Windows: Just download Python from the PSF.
 
TIP: If you're using Windows, be sure to select the option that adds Python.exe to your system path during installation. You can do this by selecting the option next to "Add python.exe to path," and then choosing your local hard drive as the install location.
Which Version Should I Use?
There are two main versions of Python, which can make things confusing for beginners and novice coders. The two versions are Python 2.x and 3.x. The good news is that when it comes to syntax, they are pretty much identical, and it's acceptable to develop with both versions.
 
Version 3.5.x of Python (or greater) is currently in active development. This means that it is constantly receiving new features and functionality, as the open source community continues to develop it. If you want bleeding edge in terms of features and support, then 3.5.x is the way to go.
 
Python versions from 2.7.x to 3.4.x (3.2.x included) are still actively maintained by the community. This is important if you need help or encounter problems. Because it's been around so long, 2.7.x also has the most support from third-party libraries. 
 
While looking at libraries, if you see they have not been ported to a newer version of Python, you'll want to stick with the older version.
 
Most importantly, once you learn one version of Python it's not difficult to make the jump to another version. If you're moving up - as in moving to a newer version - you'll simply need to learn the new features and functions. If you're moving backward you shouldn't encounter any problems although you will have to figure out what functions are incompatible with the older version.
 
Long story short, it's entirely up to you which version of Python you use! There's no right or wrong answer, and it's painless to make the jump from one version to another should you realize you need to do so later on.
